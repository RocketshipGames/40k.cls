# 40k.cls

This repository provides a LaTeX file and a few associated graphics
for tournament packets, mission writeups, and fan supplements.

Some examples in use:
 * [Recon Squad](http://rocketshipgames.com/games/recon-squad/recon-squad.pdf)
 * [The Debacle on Caldor IV](http://www.pagegaming.com/index.php?n=Warhammer40k.20141122Tournament)

If you make use of this I'd love to hear about it!
